trouble in editing the present volume, the value of which cannot but be much
enbanced by having been superintended by the first historica] antiquary of Scotland.

This chartulary of the Priory of St. Andrews appears to have escaped the
notice of Dalrymple, Sibbald, Keith, and other antiquaries of the beginning
of the last century; and its existence was unknown even to Martine, the local
historiari of St. Andrews, and his editor.

Another and altogether different Register of the same house did indeed excite
great attention, and, when lost, was the cause of much regret to the Scotch his-
torical enquirer. The first notice we have of it, is in an earlier stage of the
proceedings which required the production of our Register3 when the same
party, the venerable Wynton‚ exhibited in the Court of the official-
“quoddam registrum quod vulgariter nuncupatur liber relationum, munimento-
“ rum, dotium, donationum, terrarum, reddituum, ecclesiarum, decimarum et
“ quarundam libertatum datarum et concessarum prioratibus ecclesie cathedralis
“ Sancti Andree et insuk supradictam The Record thus produced was cer-
tainly not the present Register, and, from the extract which follows, it is at least
probable that it was the book long afterwards known and regretted, under the
name of ‘⁶ MAGNUM RnersTnUM PmonATus SAnc'rr Ammmzff'

Sir James Dalrymple⁹ informs us, that the great Register of the Priory of
St. Andrews had been missing ever since 1660. Fortunately‚ however, a list of
its Contents had previously been made, together with some Extracts, which have
furnished the most authentia among the scanty materials for the early history
of Scotland, civil as well as ecclesiastical. T hose Extracts, copied at an
unfortunate time for any hope of accuracy, came into the collection of Sir
Robert Sibbald, who makes repeated mention of Ex'rRAc'rA QUAEDAM DE
nsscrs'rno PRIORATus SAxcn Annam? as in his own possessi0n3 while he
states that he had never seen the original. In one particular, Sibbald must
have fallen into error. He has noted⁴ that “ Mr George Martyne sayeth,
“it (the Registrum Prior-atus Sancti Andree) is yett extant; and I find by
“ Sir James Balfour his writtings, he heth seen it.” Balfour undoubtedly
may have seen the lost Register, and it can scarcely be supposed that he should

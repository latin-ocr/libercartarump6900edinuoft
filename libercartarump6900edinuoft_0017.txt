PREFACE.

ΟΝ the aad ‘day of December 1413, the ever memorable Andrew of Wynton‚
Prior of St. Servans Isle of Lochleven, in vindication of the rights of his house,
brought from the archivum seu armarium publicum of the cathedra] of St.
Andoews, and produced in the Court of the Official of the Diocese‚ a certain
Register or book of Record,' commonly called—LIBER CARTARUM‚ MUMMEN-
Torum, norum, DoNA'rIoNUM‚ TEREARUM, REDDITUUM, ECCLE51ARUM, DECI-
MARuM Er QUARUNDAM LIBERTATUM Μετ’ ΕΤ coNCEss' Pmoun-Inus EchESIE
CA‘runnnAMs Simon Annuizn, ET INsULE surnAchE. The Register of
the Priory of the Cathedral church of St. Andrews‚ from which the following
sheets have been faithfully printed in the exact order of the original, is the
volume so exhibited·in judgment by the venerable historian of Scotland, four
centuries ago. A few deeds more modern and comparatively unimportant, have
been added at the beginning, including a record of the proceedings which enable
us to identify the existing register with a record admitted as authentia at so
early a period. ¹

It appears that the leaves of the Register, which are now numbered in red let-
ters, were not then so marked ; but we leam that the charter by Bishop Robert, of
the Isle of Lochleven, was at the beginning of the book, which is on the leaf now

¹ Page 15 irffra. The deeds there referred
to, are all found in the present Reglster ,- and
the minute enumeration of the lines quoted,
precisely agrees with their several entries. In

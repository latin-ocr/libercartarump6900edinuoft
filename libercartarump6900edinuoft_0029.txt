into Tranent. Dumuech is now spelt Drumoak‚ but the popular pronunciation
is at least as near the old spelling. Many of thenames which at first sight
puzzle the reader will be explained by referring to the Index, where the various
modes in which the name of a place or person is spelled often suggests some
similarity or connexion with the present name. In a few instances the old name
has altogether disappeared3 and the-local antiquary must trust to other sources
of information to enable him to discover in Conveth, the modern parish of
Laurencekirk. The subject of old topography and the ancient nomenclature of
the country, is one that has never been studied with patience and research in
Scotland. It is a very curious inquiry, and might lead to important results.

From the last article engrossed in our Register, we learn somewhat of the
life and manners of the age of the gallant king James Ι. In 1438, Jamys of
Kyninmond of that Ilke, among other demands, in the Court of the Lord Prior,
asserted his right to the offices of Bailie, Steward‚ and Marischal, under the
Prior, which we have seen his remote ancestors held under the early Bishops.
His demand runs in good set phrase—“ Ι clame thir poynctis in fee and
‘⁶ heritage, wyth houshald for me and twa gentilmen, twa yhemen‚ with the
“ boyis folowand my wyse, and twa gentill women with hir, wyth sic houshald
“ as afferis3 a falcoune and a goishauk3 a braiss of greuhundis and a coppil of
‘⁶ rachis3 the best chaumer, the best stabill, next my lordis; with fourty pund
“ of fee folowand thir officis-”¹

The charter of Hugh de Lacy, Earl of Ulster, confirmed by Henry ΙΙΙ. of
England‚⁹ may be interesting to the Irish antiquary, especially if it furnishes
information- of a member of that great family not hitherto known by genealogists.
The connexion of the granter with a convent so distant as our Canons cannot
be easily divined‚ and the gift may perhaps only show the general cultivation of
a good under-standing between England and Scotland at that period.³ · The
subjects of the charter are the churches of Carlingford in the county Louth, and
Ruskach, which was then a separate parish, but is now known as a chapelry
belonging to Carlingford.

Such are a few of ,the incidental points that may interest the general reader.
The student of historical antiquities will find in these charters a rich and almost
unexplored mine of materials, more valuable than mere annals and pedigreeS‚

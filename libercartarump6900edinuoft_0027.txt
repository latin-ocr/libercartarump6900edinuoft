May at the mouth of the Firth of Forth‚ which was acquired from the Abbot of
Reading by Bishop W illiam Lamberton ; ¹ but the deeds here preserved' afford
but scanty materials for illustrating its history, its saints, and its fishery, which
attracted to this little rock, crowds of foreigners and of Scotch‚ from the earliest
period of our reem-ds?

There is a curious illustration of the mixed stock from which the lowlanders
of Scotland are sprung, in a charter of Malcolm IV.,⁴ which is addressed in
an usual style to the king's officers and lieges, whether French, English, Scotch‚
or Galwegians, and grants to the Canons the Trinity Church of Kilrimund, with
the dues payable to it by the inhabitants of the burgh of St. Andrews‚ who are
described as made up of Scotch‚ Frencb, Flemings, and English.

Of the state of the population at a very early period, our Register incidentally
affords the most authentic evidence. We find nativi or serfs both conveyed, as
was customary, as a pertinent of the land, and sometimes given away without the
land.⁵ The occupation of the unreclaimed country, and with it the employment
and habits of a large class of the rural inhabitants, are frequently detailed.⁶

Many of these transactions show an accurate and artificial system of law process
and record, chiefly, however, in the church courts, ‘which our Canons naturally
preferred to the lay judicatures. An instance of the clashing of the two juris-
dictions occurs in a dispute with Saher de Quinci‚ regarding the patronage of
the church of Leuchars. The layman preferred pleading in the king's court,
and there obtained a settlement. The Prior afterwards protested it was wrung
from him by the threats of the king, and represented it as illegal, and in enorm
lesion of the Church. The Pope, without hesitation, appointed his commis·-
sioners to investigate and decide the whole matter according to the Canon.⁷

A few minor particulars may be thrown together. In a division of the profits

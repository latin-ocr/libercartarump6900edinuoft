On the margin of fil. 113, where the charters of the church of Dull are
recorded, is noted :—

fidedignis audiuim9 anno gfe · co⁰ · cc⁰ · octuag⁰ -

On the same leaf, where the land of Hachadgouan in Tarhlund is mentioned :—-
(ἶ ῃῡο vocat2 Cothilstane
And below the charter of Migaveth, on fi'l· 114,—
‘Pra ecce de ‹nigaveth vocatz pettentagart ·
On the margin of the charter of Richard Lupellus (sol. 119. b.) is marked :—
Carta de Wommys ·
And at the foot offil. 53 b. is the following memorandum 2-
obiit Robert9 soom eps as dffi σοῦ (3010 .

which, though faint, seems not imperfect. It is certain, however, that Bishop
Robert lived till after the accession of Malcolm3 and there is no reason to
doubt the correctness of the chronicles of Melros and Holyrood, which fix the

date of his death in 1158-9.

The following short charter is written on the margin of jol. 111. b. It seems
to be the first grant of the church of Markinch‚ confirmed by king William at
a later period (p. 216) 2—-

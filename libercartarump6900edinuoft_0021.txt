a reg-istrum monasterii S. Andsree, evidently corresponding with the sixth article
of the Contents of the “Magnum Registrum,”—the decision of the difference
between the Culdees and the Bishop in 1309. This has been printed at the end
of the preface.¹ Many of the charters which form the subjects of the list of
contents of the ‘⁶ Magnum Registrum,” are either still preserved in their
original shape, or recorded in the chartularies of Dryburgh, Dunfermline,
Kelso, Jedburgh, Paisley, Cambuskenneth, and Scone; and the loss of these
registered copies would have been insignificant had it not been accompanied
by the irreparable loss of the lists of kings and other historical fragments,
which seem to have been casually interspersed in the volume. One interesting
part of these is supplied by the present recordz⁹ and, as a collection of the
proper muniments of the Priory, it is greatly fuller and more valuable than the
missing Register was.

Merely viewed ,as the Record of the chapter of the Metropolitan and Primatial
See of Scotland, the Register of St. Andrews must be considered of great interest
and importance.

The Priory of Canons Regular of the order of St. Augustin‚ founded, or at
least first endowed with any considerable possessions, by Robert Bishop of
St Andrews‚ in 1144? confirmed in its functions of electoral chapter of the
Bishopric by Pope Eugenius ΙΙΙ. three years later,⁴ soon took its place as the
first in rank and wealth of the Religious Houses of Scotland: and the Prior,
, with the ring and mitre and symbols of Episcopacy,⁵ had rank and place in
Parliament above Abbots and all other prelates of the regular clergy.

The collection of the writs of such a foundation, though illustrating chiefly
its own neighbourhood, yet, as connected with the Chapter of the Cathedral, have
a wider range, and throw light on the early condition of the whole diocese,
extending from the English border almost to Aberdeen. The possessions of the
House went even beyond this ample diocese, and included property in land as
well as tithes, far in the fastnesses of Mar and beyond the Grampians.

The Register will be found by no means devoid of arrangement, though its
order is often broken by interpolations. Beginning with the eommeneement of
the most ancient part of the Record, we find, first, Papal Bulls 3 ⁶ and then, in

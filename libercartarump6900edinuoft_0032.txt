12 nov only munim to notice, that the Register, ample as it seems, does not ’
cont-im by any means, all the chartei-s existing in favour of the Priory of St.
Andrews. A few of the original chartei-s have already been referred to. But
many others are extant. The chief repertory of these is in two large volumes,'
now in the Advocato-⁹ Library, in which Sir J ames Balfour had pasted a multi-
tude of char-tere and Bulla, the greater number relating to St. Andrews. Some
of thoee are recorded in this Regimen others are perhaps part of the subjecta

of the loct ‘⁴ Registrum Magnum.” To facilitate reference to these, a list of
such of the Charters and Bulls in the two volumes as concern our Priory, copied

from the catalogue of the manuscripts of the Library‚ is subjoined to this prefaoe.

Finally, an original charter of St. David, granting to the Hospital of St.

Andrews the lande of Kenlachyn, which is neither recorded in our Register‚ nor

included in Balfour's collection, but which was the subject of successive confir-

, mations by Malcolm (p. 195), by William (p. 211), and by Alexander (p. 233),
is here added.

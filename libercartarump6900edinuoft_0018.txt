numbered xviii. The leaves at present prefixed to lt, have been inserted soon
afterwards, since their contents are noticed in the Table now at the beginning of
the volume, written about the middle of the fifteenth century.¹ Some of these
leaves, however, are of a much more ancient date, and the memoranda and
“ taxationes”' may have either formed part of another Register, or perhaps
stood iu a different part of this, when it was used by the Prior of Lochleven.

The Register is a small folio volume, not in its original binding, consisting of
196 leaves of vellum, which have all been numbered and in their present posi-
tion, as early as the middle os the fifteenth century.

From folio 20 to solio 152 inclusive, the deeds are engrossed sometimes in
single, sometimes in double columns, by several different hands, but, with very
few exception& in writing of the thirteenth century.8

From the 152d leaf to the 169th, the hand-writing is of the 14th century3
and the remainder of the volume is in a later hand.

For a considerable time this important Register has been preserved in the
library at Panmure ς· and the members of the Club are indebted to the liberality
of the Lord Panmurc for permitting it to be printed for their use. To their
President, who has already conferred so many benefits on the Club, the contributor
sind the other members owe their best thanks for directing attention to this record,
and obtaining his Lordship's permission to publish it; and afterwards for his great

than its own date.

At sol. 37, the charters of the chapel of

period than the very beginning of the uth
